# PHYS 250: Computational Physics
Welcome to the University of Chicago PHYS 250 Computational Physics repository!

This repository will hold the Syllabus, Learning Goals, Code Examples, and Lecture Notes for the course. Periodically, some of these materials will be moved to the Canvas page for the course, which for the Autumn 2018 Academic Quarter is located here:

https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/16987

## Programming Languages, Software, and Platforms for the course
We will primarily be using Python for this course as it is a common, powerful, and high-levle language that is used across much of academia and industry in one form or another.

### Software

One of the primary "sets" of packages that we will be using is referred to as the "scipy stack"

* https://www.scipy.org/

The reason for this is that it includes these incredibly powerful, ubiquitous, and useful packages:

* numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
* matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/
* IPython/Jupyter: http://ipython.org/
* pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/

### Platform
One of the easiest to use applications for python-based computational physics is Jupyter Notebooks. 

* http://jupyter.org/

These are interactive, easy-to-use interfaces that make writing simple and moderately complex software programs enjoyable and straightforward. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

We also have a platform that provisions (creates, maintains, and hosts) Jupyter Notebook instances on-demand:

To use this service, you will need an account.
