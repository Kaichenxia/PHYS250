\textbf{Description:}           & This course introduces the use of computers in the physical sciences. 
                                  After an introduction to programming basics, we will cover numerical solutions 
                                  to fundamental types of problems, techniques for manipulating large data
                                  sets, neural networks, and the basics of data analysis. \\
